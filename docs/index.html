          Iâ€™m Sandeep â€” a full-stack engineer with 3 years of experience building web applications across fintech, SaaS, and
          automation platforms. I primarily work with Python, React, and Postgres, and have built everything from internal tools
          to production-scale systems. I care deeply about clean, maintainable code on both the frontend and backend, and I aim to
          ship thoughtful, reliable features that solve real problems.

              <h3>Using Djangoâ€™s Custom Management Commands to Execute Workflows with Application Context</h3>
              <p class="log-date">July 20, 2025</p>
              <p><p>At a previous job, one of my colleagues was tasked with a one-off project: processing a large number of files (over 20,000, if I recall correctly) using a third-party service and storing a subset of the results in our database. Here's a breakdown of how we approached it.</p>
<p>Ideally, we wouldâ€™ve used a bulk API: upload all files in one go, receive the processed results, and save them to the database. Unfortunately, the third-party service didnâ€™t support bulk processing at the time â€” only single-file operations were available. This meant we had to process files serially.</p>
<p>We also wanted to leverage our existing Django application â€” its models, settings, and utility functions â€” to perform the task efficiently and consistently.</p>
<p>One idea was to use the Django shell (<code>python manage.py shell</code>) to import the necessary objects and orchestrate the process manually. This could have worked, and technically we might have added threading for some performance gains.</p>
<p>But using the shell this way quickly became cumbersome and error-prone for such a large task.</p>
<p>So we considered a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up <strong>Celery</strong> and workers to queue and handle the jobs</li>
<li>Writing a standalone script that used Django's context</li>
<li>Creating a <strong>custom Django management command</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since this was a one-time task and didnâ€™t justify setting up a full queuing system like Celery, we decided to go with the third option: a custom Django management command.</p>
<p>This solution gave us a clean way to structure the code and run it via <code>python manage.py process_files</code>. More importantly, it let us run everything within the Django application context â€” giving seamless access to models, settings, and business logic without additional boilerplate.</p>

              <p><p>I plan to treat these logs as dump of interesting idea I come across in my software engineering practise. The goal is to give anyone who might work with me a peek into how I think â€” no BS, just real stuff I find worth sharing.</p>
